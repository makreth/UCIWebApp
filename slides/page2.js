    <h1>Why did I apply to this position?</h1>
    <p>I'm applying to this position to get professional experience as a web developer. I have plenty of hobbyist experience with
    programming in general, and I also taught HTML/CSS/JS professionally, but I never worked directly as a web developer.
    I would love to take up the opportunity to design and build user interfaces that meet UCI's high standards, while taking steps towards
    building a career that I can be proud of.</p>
    <p>
    Front-end development for me is a perfect mix between creativity and logic. Using the programming tools available to me,
    I can utilize them to bolster my creative expression. One such example of this is using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to
    add an extra dimension of interactivity to any website, expressing strokes and shapes using code.
    </p>
    <p>Below is an SVG image that I designed for my portfolio in progress.</p>
    <div class="svg-container">
        <object class="slide-icon" type="image/svg+xml" data="logo.svg">
        </object>
    </div>
