    <h1>My Philosophy</h1>
    <p>Now more than ever, I realize that working together with others is paramount to not only my own success,
    but to the success of communities and people that I care about. On my journey to becoming a developer, I spent
    a lot of time programming alone. I focused on improving my skill and putting together projects that I could 
    be proud of.</p>
    <p>However, doing it alone stops me from fully realizing what I have to offer. Discouragement becomes
    so much more debilitating without the encouragement of others. I hope to strive to not only become better at my craft,
    but to also improve on working with others, helping others, and contributing to the community, because doing so
    will allow me to reach greater heights. </p>
